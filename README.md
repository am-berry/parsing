## To remember

- urllib memory leaks in 3.7/3.8 so use 3.6 if needing to run download_data again
- run `source getters/run.sh` to download, parse everything
- Without last 3 months, it's about 19.5 million examples

- After finished, run `cargo build` > `cargo run` to write all to a csv file in /src/
