# Notes on Yang, Lapata 2019 (Text Summarisation with pretrained encoders)

- Significant difference between summarisation and other tasks is the need for document-level understanding rather than word or sentence level.
- In the abstractive sense, this also requires language generation capabilities.
- Extractive summarisation can be considered a binary classification on text spans being included in the summary or not.
