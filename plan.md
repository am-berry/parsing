# Thesis plan

Checklist for programming tasks:

- Want to parse as many of the reddit posts into a huge csv file: to this end,
    write a bash script to download all the files from pushshift, then loop
    them in `src/main.rs`

- Have this done by end of August: so far, the parser for a json lines file has
been written (bulk of the task), as well as a Python script for verifying the
quality. Just need to write the bash script and run.
